This sophomore project is a practical assignment for the student who enrolls in the program design course, which involves the use of the Python programming language and the Google API web services. 

The author has implemented his learning by working with different data types such as lists, JSON, dictionaries, and tuples. For testing conditions, the author has utilized for-loops and while-loops to ensure that the project performs as intended.

The project involves working with Google API to send requests and retrieve data, which involves knowledge of working with web services by using the requests module from Google. Additionally, the author has practiced recording, editing, and distributing the code and video of the project to those who are interested in Youtube and Github. 

Overall, this project offers a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned about Python programming language in a practical setting and improve through trial and error.

Remark : Please note that the fare calculation including price per km, and base fare are based on BOLT application.
